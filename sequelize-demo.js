// advantages of ORM over traditional query approach

// Developers can only focus on business logic rather than writing interfaces
// between code and db. Reduces development time and costs by avoiding
// redundant codes Capable of connecting to different databases, which comes
// handy during switching from one db to the other. Helps to effectively query
// from multiple tables similar to SQL JOINâ€”ORM takes the responsibility of
// converting the object-oriented query approach to SQL queries.



// Getter and setter methods 
	// In Sequelize, we can define pseudo properties on
// a model. These properties are not an actual part of the database schema,
// they are just for the models. In the example above, "address" is a pseudo-
// property, and its value is initialized through getter and setter methods.
// When state and country are fetched from db, Sequelize merges them with a
// comma to populate the "address" property (getterMethods). Similarly, when
// we set the address, it gets split into state and country (setterMethods).
// Thus, the "address" seems like a column in db but actually it's not.

var sequelize = new Sequelize('mysql://username:password@localhost:5432/db_name');
